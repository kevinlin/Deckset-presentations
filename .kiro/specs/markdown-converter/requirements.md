# Enhanced Requirements Document

## Introduction

This enhancement will transform the current basic website generator into a comprehensive Deckset-compatible markdown-to-HTML converter. The system will support all Deckset markdown features including slide separators, image placement options, speaker notes, code highlighting, mathematical formulas, video/audio embedding, and advanced layout features like multi-column layouts and fit text. The goal is to faithfully reproduce Deckset's markdown semantics in a responsive web environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Deckset Markdown Compatibility

**User Story:** As a presentation author, I want to use all standard Deckset markdown features in my presentations, so that I can leverage my existing Deckset knowledge and content for the web.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters slide separators (`---`) THEN it SHALL split content into individual slides
2. WHEN the system processes headings with `[fit]` modifier THEN it SHALL scale the heading to fit the slide width and add `class="fit"` to the HTML element
2.1. WHEN global `fit-headers: #, ##` configuration is set THEN the system SHALL automatically apply fit scaling to all headers of the specified levels
3. WHEN the system encounters speaker notes (lines starting with `^`) THEN it SHALL hide them from slide content but make them accessible
4. WHEN the system processes global commands (e.g., `slidenumbers: true`, `footer: text`) THEN it SHALL apply them to all slides
5. WHEN the system encounters slide-specific commands (e.g., `[.column]`, `[.background-image: file.jpg]`) THEN it SHALL apply them only to that slide
6. WHEN automatic slide breaks are enabled (`slide-dividers: #, ##`) THEN the system SHALL create new slides at specified heading levels

### Requirement 2: Advanced Image and Media Support

**User Story:** As a presentation author, I want full control over image placement and scaling options, so that I can create visually compelling presentations with proper image layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image uses `![](image.jpg)` syntax without modifiers THEN it SHALL be treated as a full-slide background with cover scaling
1.1. WHEN background images are displayed THEN they SHALL be visible above the slide background but below the content text and UI elements
2. WHEN an image uses `![fit](image.jpg)` syntax THEN it SHALL fit entirely on the slide with letterboxing if needed
3. WHEN an image uses `![left](image.jpg)` or `![right](image.jpg)` THEN it SHALL occupy the left or right half of the slide
4. WHEN an image uses `![inline](image.jpg)` THEN it SHALL appear as part of the content flow
5. WHEN an image uses `![inline fill](image.jpg)` THEN it SHALL fill the slide width while remaining inline
6. WHEN an image uses percentage scaling (e.g., `![inline 50%](image.jpg)`) THEN it SHALL scale to that percentage of slide width
7. WHEN multiple inline images are consecutive THEN they SHALL arrange in a grid layout
8. WHEN an image uses `![original](image.jpg)` THEN no darkening filter SHALL be applied
9. WHEN an image uses `![filtered](image.jpg)` THEN a darkening filter SHALL be applied for text readability
10. WHEN an image uses `corner-radius(n)` modifier THEN it SHALL apply border-radius styling

### Requirement 3: Video and Audio Embedding

**User Story:** As a presentation author, I want to embed videos and audio files in my presentations, so that I can create multimedia-rich content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters `![](video.mp4)` THEN it SHALL embed an HTML5 video player
2. WHEN the system encounters `![](audio.mp3)` THEN it SHALL embed an HTML5 audio player
3. WHEN video/audio uses `autoplay` modifier THEN it SHALL start playing automatically (with browser policy compliance)
4. WHEN video/audio uses `loop` modifier THEN it SHALL repeat when finished
5. WHEN video/audio uses `mute` modifier THEN it SHALL start muted
6. WHEN video/audio uses `hide` modifier THEN the visual element SHALL be hidden but audio SHALL still play
7. WHEN the system encounters YouTube URLs THEN it SHALL embed them as iframes
8. WHEN video uses positioning modifiers (`left`, `right`) THEN it SHALL position accordingly like images

### Requirement 4: Code Block Enhancement

**User Story:** As a presentation author, I want advanced code highlighting and line emphasis features, so that I can effectively present code examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters fenced code blocks with language identifiers THEN it SHALL apply syntax highlighting
2. WHEN a code block is preceded by `[.code-highlight: N]` THEN it SHALL highlight line N
3. WHEN a code block is preceded by `[.code-highlight: X-Y]` THEN it SHALL highlight lines X through Y
4. WHEN a code block is preceded by `[.code-highlight: all]` THEN it SHALL highlight all lines
5. WHEN a code block is preceded by `[.code-highlight: none]` THEN no lines SHALL be highlighted
6. WHEN global `code-language: X` is set THEN unlabeled code blocks SHALL use language X for highlighting
7. WHEN code blocks overflow horizontally THEN they SHALL be scrollable while preserving formatting

### Requirement 5: Mathematical Formula Support

**User Story:** As a presentation author, I want to include mathematical formulas in my presentations, so that I can create technical and scientific content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters `$$...$$` delimiters THEN it SHALL render the content as display math using MathJax
2. WHEN the system encounters `$...$` delimiters THEN it SHALL render the content as inline math
3. WHEN math formulas are too wide for the slide THEN they SHALL scale down or allow horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN MathJax fails to load THEN the system SHALL display the raw LaTeX as fallback

### Requirement 6: Multi-Column Layout Support

**User Story:** As a presentation author, I want to create multi-column layouts within slides, so that I can organize content more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters `[.column]` directive THEN it SHALL start a new column on the same slide
2. WHEN multiple `[.column]` directives exist THEN content SHALL be distributed across columns with equal width
3. WHEN columns contain different amounts of content THEN they SHALL align to the top
4. WHEN viewing on narrow screens THEN columns SHALL stack vertically for readability
5. WHEN three or more columns exist THEN each SHALL receive approximately equal width with appropriate gaps

### Requirement 7: Advanced Text and Layout Features

**User Story:** As a presentation author, I want advanced text formatting and layout options, so that I can create professional-looking presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters blockquotes with `-- Author` attribution THEN it SHALL format them with proper citation styling
2. WHEN the system encounters footnotes (`[^1]` and `[^1]: text`) THEN it SHALL display them at the bottom of the slide

4. WHEN the system encounters tables THEN it SHALL render them with proper alignment based on separator markers
5. WHEN global `autoscale: true` is set THEN text SHALL scale down when it overflows the slide
6. WHEN slide numbers are enabled (`slidenumbers: true`) THEN each slide SHALL display its number
7. WHEN footer text is set (`footer: text`) THEN it SHALL appear on every slide unless overridden

### Requirement 8: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want presentations to work well on all devices and be accessible, so that I can view content regardless of my device or abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL have appropriate alt text for screen readers

6. WHEN printing or saving as PDF THEN each slide SHALL start on a new page

### Requirement 9: Enhanced Error Handling and Validation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid Deckset syntax is encountered THEN the system SHALL log specific warnings with line numbers
2. WHEN referenced images are missing THEN the system SHALL use fallback images and log warnings
3. WHEN video/audio files are missing THEN the system SHALL display placeholder content and continue processing
