# üèÜ Bonus Task: Improve Chat Experience

## Task: Context-Aware Chat and Streaming Responses

- Make the RAG application **context-aware** by including past chat conversations in the LLM prompt.

^ This helps maintain conversation context and provide a more fluid chat interaction.

---

# üèÜ Bonus Task: Collect User Feedback on Responses

## Collect User Feedback

- Implement simple controls like **Thumb Up** or **Thumb Down** for users to rate the chatbot's response.
- Feedback will help evaluate the quality of each response.

## Incorporate Feedback

- Think of ways to use feedback data to **improve response quality**.
- Example approaches:
    - Analyze **negative feedback** and adjust the **retrieval** or **generation** process.
    - Use **positive feedback** to reinforce successful response patterns.

^ Consider persisting the feedback together with the chat conversation to identify recurring issues or successes.

---

# üèÜ Bonus Task: Switching to Streaming Responses

- Switch to a **streaming approach** to make responses feel more interactive and improve user experience.
- This allows the user to see the response as it is generated, rather than waiting for the entire answer.
